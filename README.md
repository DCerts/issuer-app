This is a part of our little project **Distributed Certificates Manager (DCM)** from [DCerts](https://github.com/DCerts).

### Usage
Install all dependencies with `Node Package Manager`:
```
npm install
```
Or if you're using `Yarn`, just run:
```
yarn install
```
Then start the application with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

That's all.
